# Internet Applications Design and Implementation (2026 Edition)

This course focuses on the principles and concepts on the development of Internet applications. The syllabus follows an
approach based on the fundamentals of software development based on web and service oriented architectural patterns,
advanced modularity mechanisms, data persistency abstractions, good development practices, performance concerns, and
validation techniques. Course lectures are accompanied by a series of practical assignments and a final project
development using frameworks, languages, and programming tools for Internet Applications that ensure the safety and
compliance of the solution with relation to a specification.
